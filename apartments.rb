# You are the dodgy head of a construction company. You jam in the most number of apartments per floor that regulations will allow. You write one method that calculates the area of floorspace from two arguments, the length and width. You write a second method that takes an area, and calculates the number of apartments you can fit within a given floorspace (you can fit one apartment in every 28 square meters, and this should be rounded down - you canâ€™t have a partial apartment). You write a third method that takes a number of floors, a length, and a width as arguments, and that returns a hash of the total number of apartments you can jam into the building, and the total money made (assuming each apartment is worth $120,000) using the previous two methods.
